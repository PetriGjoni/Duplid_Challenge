# Duplid_Challenge
Challenge for Software Engineer Internship at Duplid\
To run the code you just need to run the following command:\
python3 challenge.py


Remark: There are two csv files, duplicates and the full duplicates. The output is the same but the difference is in the colums added there. 
The full duplicates has all the columns needed while the other one has only the most important ones.
